Difference between = and ==
The = is a simple assignment operator.
It assigns values from right side operands to the left side operand.
While on the other hand == checks if the values of two operands are equal or not.

**operator
In Python, the ** operator is used for exponentiation.
It raises the first operand to the power of the second operand.

caret operator
It's a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR).
It evaluates to True if and only if its arguments differ (one is True, the other is False).
